‚ö° Flash USDT Simulation PortalThis repository hosts a simple, single-page interactive web application designed to simulate a two-step crypto redemption process. It serves as a static prototype to demonstrate conditional access and form validation within a modern dark-mode interface.üöÄ Live SiteThe simulation is hosted live using GitHub Pages:Link: https://knightrider96k.github.io/Flash-USDT/‚öôÔ∏è How the Simulation Works (Access Codes)The application uses client-side JavaScript to enforce a two-stage validation process. You must enter specific codes to proceed and simulate a successful transaction.StageInput FieldRequired ValuePurposeStage 1Redeem Codeflasherking (case-insensitive)Unlocks the main Wallet Details form.Stage 2Activation Keyfskixgev5hdh79hdjwb6Triggers the final "Success: Transfer Complete!" message.Note: Any other value used for the Activation Key will result in a "Failure: Invalid Activation Key" message.üõ†Ô∏è Technical DetailsThis project is built as a complete, self-contained Single Page Application (SPA) using a minimal frontend stack:Structure: Single index.html file.Styling: Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN) for a fully responsive, professional dark-mode UI.Logic: Pure Vanilla JavaScript for state management, form validation, and page transitions (simulating a multi-page workflow within a single file).
